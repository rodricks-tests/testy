### **useDeferredValue(value, initialValue?)**** **
Call useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to get a deferred version of that value.
import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';
function SearchPage() {
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
// ...
}
[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue#usage)
#### **Parameters **
- value: The value you want to defer. It can have any type.
- **optional** initialValue: A value to use during the initial render of a component. If this option is omitted, useDeferredValue will not defer during the initial render, because there’s no previous version of value that it can render instead.
#### **Returns **
- currentValue: During the initial render, the returned deferred value will be the initialValue, or the same as the value you provided. During updates, React will first attempt a re-render with the old value (so it will return the old value), and then try another re-render in the background with the new value (so it will return the updated value).
#### **Caveats **
- When an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.
- The values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.
- When useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)[Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.
- useDeferredValue is integrated with[link](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)[<Suspense>](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)[.](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads.
- useDeferredValue does not by itself prevent extra network requests.
- There is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.
- The background re-render caused by useDeferredValue does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates.
## **Usage **
### **Showing stale content while fresh content is loading **
Call useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.
import { useState, useDeferredValue } from 'react';
function SearchPage() {
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
// ...
}
During the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.
During updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render *without* updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background.
**Let’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.**
### **Note**
This example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:
- Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/rendering/loading-states/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data#with-suspense)
- Lazy-loading component code with [lazy](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy)
- Reading the value of a Promise with [use](https://react.dev/reference/react/use)
[Learn more about Suspense and its limitations.](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)
In this example, the SearchResults component[link](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading)[suspends](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#displaying-a-fallback-while-content-is-loading) while fetching the search results. Try typing "a", waiting for the results, and then editing it to "ab". The results for "a" get replaced by the loading fallback.

A common alternative UI pattern is to *defer* updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down:
export default function App() {
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
return (
<>
<label>
Search albums:
<input value={query} onChange={e => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
</label>
<Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading...</h2>}>
<SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />
</Suspense>
</>
);
}
The query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.
Enter "a" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to "ab". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:

### **Indicating that the content is stale **
In the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:
<div style={{
opacity: query !== deferredQuery ? 0.5 : 1,
}}>
<SearchResults query={deferredQuery} />
</div>
With this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:

### **Deferring re-rendering for a part of the UI **
You can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.
Imagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:
function App() {
const [text, setText] = useState('');
return (
<>
<input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
<SlowList text={text} />
</>
);
}
First, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this,[link](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged)[wrap it in](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged)[memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged)[:](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#skipping-re-rendering-when-props-are-unchanged)
const SlowList = memo(function SlowList({ text }) {
// ...
});
However, this only helps if the SlowList props are *the same* as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re *different,* and when you actually need to show different visual output.
Concretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):
function App() {
const [text, setText] = useState('');
const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text);
return (
<>
<input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
<SlowList text={deferredText} />
</>
);
}
This does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.
#### **The difference between useDeferredValue and unoptimized re-rendering**
1. Deferred re-rendering of the list2. Unoptimized re-rendering of the list
#### **Example 1 of 2: **Deferred re-rendering of the list
In this example, each item in the SlowList component is **artificially slowed down** so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.

### **Pitfall**
This optimization requires SlowList to be wrapped in[link](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo)[memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo)[.](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without[link](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo)[memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo)[,](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.
