# **prefetchDNS**
prefetchDNS lets you eagerly look up the IP of a server that you expect to load resources from.
prefetchDNS("https://example.com");

## **Reference **
### **prefetchDNS(href)**** **
To look up a host, call the prefetchDNS function from react-dom.
import { prefetchDNS } from 'react-dom';
function AppRoot() {
prefetchDNS("https://example.com");
// ...
}
[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/prefetchDNS#usage)
The prefetchDNS function provides the browser with a hint that it should look up the IP address of a given server. If the browser chooses to do so, this can speed up the loading of resources from that server.
#### **Parameters **
- href: a string. The URL of the server you want to connect to.
#### **Returns **
prefetchDNS returns nothing.
#### **Caveats **
- Multiple calls to prefetchDNS with the same server have the same effect as a single call.
- In the browser, you can call prefetchDNS in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
- In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, prefetchDNS only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.
- If you know the specific resources you’ll need, you can call [other functions](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom#resource-preloading-apis) instead that will start loading the resources right away.
- There is no benefit to prefetching the same server the webpage itself is hosted from because it’s already been looked up by the time the hint would be given.
- Compared with [preconnect](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preconnect), prefetchDNS may be better if you are speculatively connecting to a large number of domains, in which case the overhead of preconnections might outweigh the benefit.
## **Usage **
### **Prefetching DNS when rendering **
Call prefetchDNS when rendering a component if you know that its children will load external resources from that host.
import { prefetchDNS } from 'react-dom';
function AppRoot() {
prefetchDNS("https://example.com");
return ...;
}
### **Prefetching DNS in an event handler **
Call prefetchDNS in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.
import { prefetchDNS } from 'react-dom';
function CallToAction() {
const onClick = () => {
prefetchDNS('http://example.com');
startWizard();
}
return (
<button onClick={onClick}>Start Wizard</button>
);
}
