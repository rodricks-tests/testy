# **preload**
### **Note**
[React-based frameworks](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call this API yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details.
preload lets you eagerly fetch a resource such as a stylesheet, font, or external script that you expect to use.
preload("https://example.com/font.woff2", {as: "font"});

## **Reference **
### **preload(href, options)**** **
To preload a resource, call the preload function from react-dom.
import { preload } from 'react-dom';
function AppRoot() {
preload("https://example.com/font.woff2", {as: "font"});
// ...
}
[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preload#usage)
The preload function provides the browser with a hint that it should start downloading the given resource, which can save time.
#### **Parameters **
- href: a string. The URL of the resource you want to download.
- options: an object. It contains the following properties:
  - as: a required string. The type of resource. Its [possible values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#as) are audio, document, embed, fetch, font, image, object, script, style, track, video, worker.
  - crossOrigin: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are anonymous and use-credentials. It is required when as is set to "fetch".
  - referrerPolicy: a string. The [Referrer header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#referrerpolicy) to send when fetching. Its possible values are no-referrer-when-downgrade (the default), no-referrer, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, and unsafe-url.
  - integrity: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
  - type: a string. The MIME type of the resource.
  - nonce: a string. A cryptographic [nonce to allow the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) when using a strict Content Security Policy.
  - fetchPriority: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are auto (the default), high, and low.
  - imageSrcSet: a string. For use only with as: "image". Specifies the [source set of the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).
  - imageSizes: a string. For use only with as: "image". Specifies the [sizes of the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).
#### **Returns **
preload returns nothing.
#### **Caveats **
- Multiple equivalent calls to preload have the same effect as a single call. Calls to preload are considered equivalent according to the following rules:
  - Two calls are equivalent if they have the same href, except:
  - If as is set to image, two calls are equivalent if they have the same href, imageSrcSet, and imageSizes.
- In the browser, you can call preload in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
- In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, preload only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.
## **Usage **
### **Preloading when rendering **
Call preload when rendering a component if you know that it or its children will use a specific resource.
#### **Examples of preloading**
1. Preloading an external script2. Preloading a stylesheet3. Preloading a font4. Preloading an image
#### **Example 1 of 4: **Preloading an external script
import { preload } from 'react-dom';
function AppRoot() {
preload("https://example.com/script.js", {as: "script"});
return ...;
}
If you want the browser to start executing the script immediately (rather than just downloading it), use[link](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinit)[preinit](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinit) instead. If you want to load an ESM module, use[link](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preloadModule)[preloadModule](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preloadModule).
**Next Example**
### **Preloading in an event handler **
Call preload in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.
import { preload } from 'react-dom';
function CallToAction() {
const onClick = () => {
preload("https://example.com/wizardStyles.css", {as: "style"});
startWizard();
}
return (
<button onClick={onClick}>Start Wizard</button>
);
}
