# justify-self

Utilities for controlling how an individual grid item is aligned along its inline axis.

## Untitled

### Untitled

Use the justify-self-auto utility to align an item based on the value of the grid's justify-items property:
01
02
03
04
05
06
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-auto ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>

### Untitled

Use the justify-self-start utility to align a grid item to the start of its inline axis:
01
02
03
04
05
06
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-start ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>

### Untitled

Use the justify-self-center or justify-self-center-safe utilities to align a grid item along the center of its inline axis:
Resize the container to see the alignment behavior
justify-self-center
01
02
03
justify-self-center-safe
01
02
03
justify-self-center
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-center ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>
justify-self-center-safe
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-center-safe ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>
When there is not enough space available, the justify-self-center-safe utility will align the item to the start of the container instead of the end.

### Untitled

Use the justify-self-end or justify-self-end-safe utilities to align a grid item to the end of its inline axis:
Resize the container to see the alignment behavior
justify-self-end
01
02
03
justify-self-end-safe
01
02
03
justify-self-end
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-end ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>
justify-self-end-safe
<div class="grid justify-items-stretch ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-end-safe ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>
When there is not enough space available, the justify-self-end-safe utility will align the item to the start of the container instead of the end.

### Untitled

Use the justify-self-stretch utility to stretch a grid item to fill the grid area on its inline axis:
01
02
03
04
05
06
<div class="grid justify-items-start ...">
<!-- ... -->
<div class="justify-self-stretch ...">02</div>
<!-- ... -->
</div>

### Untitled

Prefix a justify-self utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<div class="justify-self-start md:justify-self-end ...">
<!-- ... -->
</div>
