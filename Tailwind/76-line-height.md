# line-height

Utilities for controlling the leading, or line height, of an element.

## Untitled

### Untitled

Use font size utilities like text-sm/6 and text-lg/7 to set the font size and line-height of an element at the same time:
text-sm/6
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
text-sm/7
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
text-sm/8
So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
<p class="text-base/6 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-base/7 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-base/8 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
Each font size utility also sets a default line height when one isn't provided. You can learn more about these values and how to customize them in the .

### Untitled

Use leading-<number> utilities like leading-6 and leading-7 to set the line height of an element independent of the font-size:
leading-6

I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
leading-7

<p class="text-sm leading-7">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-sm leading-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>

### Untitled

Use the leading-none utility to set the line height of an element equal to its font size:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
<p class="text-2xl leading-none ...">The quick brown fox...</p>

### Untitled

Use the leading-[<value>] syntax to set the line height based on a completely custom value:
<p class="leading-[1.5] ...">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</p>
For CSS variables, you can also use the leading-(<custom-property>) syntax:
<p class="leading-(--my-line-height) ...">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</p>
This is just a shorthand for leading-[var(<custom-property>)] that adds the var() function for you automatically.

### Untitled

Prefix a line-height utility with a breakpoint variant like md: to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:
<p class="leading-5 md:leading-6 ...">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</p>

## Untitled

The leading-<number> utilities are driven by the --spacing theme variable, which can be customized in your own theme:
@theme {
--spacing: 1px;
}
